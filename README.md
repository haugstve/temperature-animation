# temperature-animation

This project is a multistage rocket. The first goal is a web page showing an up-to-date version of the famous animation by [Ed Hawkins](https://twitter.com/ed_hawkins/status/729753441459945474 "Animation on Twitter"). The second goal is to make the same animation for different regions. There is no detailed roadmap only this goal. However, it is possible the identify the current state of the project from the todo-list.

## DONE Plan project
This step of the plan is never done, but future revisions to the plan will not be placed as a step in the plan.

## Sync project to local computer
- Read about the integration between Git, GitHub and RStudio [here](http://happygitwithr.com)
- Decide on a solutino
- Implement that solution

## Scrape data
- DONE Locate the data
- CANCELED Learn how to scrape data using R
- CANCELED Scrape data 
- Load data as a local file in R

## Plot temprature
Make a static plot similar to the last frame in the animation. You want to make the plot using ggplot.

## Learn animations
If possible use a package close to ggplot.
- Search for packages
- Search for tutorials
- Implement a tutorial

## Create the animation 

## Make a webpage which can host the animation

## Deploy the animation 

## Update how often the animation loads the relevant data
